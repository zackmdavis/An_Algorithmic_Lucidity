# Hazards of Selection Effects on Approved Information

In a busy, busy world, there's so much to read that no one could possibly keep up with it all. You can't _not_ prioritize what you pay attention to and (even more so) what you respond to. Everyone and her dog tells herself that she wants to pay attention to "good" (true, useful) information and ignore "bad" (false, useless) information.

Unfortunately, there's a difference between the story everyone and her dog tells herself, and the behavior of everyone and her dog as an information-processing system in the physical universe. The story doesn't necessarily need to be true. There's nothing stopping me from telling myself a story about how I seek out true and useful information, while in fact seeking out information that _feels_ good, but which might actually be false or useless.

Keeping the story true turns out to be a harder problem than it sounds. Everyone and her dog knows that the map is not the territory, but the reason we need a whole slogan about it is because we never actually have unmediated access to the territory. Everything we think we know about the territory is actually just part of our map (the world-simulation our brains construct from sensory data), which makes it easy to get confused about whether your actions are improving the real territory, or just your view of it on your map.

For example, I like it when I have good ideas. It makes sense for me to like that. I endorse taking actions that will result in world-states in which I have good ideas.

The problem is that I might not be able to tell the difference between world-states in which I have good ideas, and world-states in which I _think_ my ideas are good, but they're actually bad. Those two different states of the territory would look the same on my map.

If my brain's learning algorithms reinforce behaviors that lead to me having ideas that I think are good, then in addition to behaviors that make me have better ideas (like reading a book), I might also inadvertently pick up behaviors that prevent me from hearing about it if my ideas are bad (like silencing critics).

This might seem like an easy problem to solve, because the most basic manifestations of the problem are in fact pretty easy to solve. If I were to throw a crying fit and yell, "Critics bad! No one is allowed to criticize my ideas!" every time someone criticized my ideas, the problem with that would be pretty obvious to everyone and her dog, and I would stop getting invited to the salon.

But what if there were subtler manifestations of the problem, that _weren't_ obvious to everyone and her dog? Then I might keep getting invited to the salon, and possibly even spread the problematic behavior to other salon members. (If they saw the behavior seeming to work for me, they might imitate it, and their brain's learning algorithms would reinforce it if it seemed to work for them.) What might those look like? Let's think about it.

## Filtering Interlocutors

> **Goofusia**: I don't see why you tolerate that distrustful witch Goody Osborne at your salon. Of course I understand the importance of criticism, which is an essential nutrient for any truthseeker. But you can acquire the nutrient without the downside of putting up with unpleasant people like her. At least, I can. I've already got plenty of perceptive critics in my life among my friends who want the truth, and know that I want the truth.
>
> **Gallantina**: But aren't your friends who know you want the truth selected for agreeing with you, over and above their being selected for being correct? If there _were_ some crushing counterargument to your beliefs that would only be found by someone who _didn't_ know that you want the truth, how would you ever hear about it?

This one is subtle. Goofusia isn't throwing a crying fit every time a member of the salon criticizes her ideas. And indeed, you can't invite the whole world to your salon. You can't _not_ do some sort of filtering. The question is whether salon invitations are being extended or withheld for "good" reasons (that promote the salon processing true and useful information) or "bad" reasons (that promote false or useless information).

The problem is that being friends with Goofusia and "know[ing] that [she and other salon members] want the truth" is a bad membership criterion, not a good one, because people who aren't friends with Goofusia and don't know that she wants the truth are likely to have different things to say. Even if Goofusia can answer all the critiques her friends can think of, that shouldn't give her confidence that her ideas are solid if there are likely to be possible serious critiques that wouldn't be independently generated by the kinds of people who become Goofusia's friends.

The "nutrient" metaphor is a tell. Goofusia seems to be thinking of criticism as if it were a homogenous ingredient necessary for a healthy epistemic environment, but that it doesn't particularly matter where it comes from. In analogy, it doesn't matter whether you get your allowance of potassium from bananas or potatoes or artificial supplements. If you find bananas and potatoes unpleasant, you can still take supplements and get the potassium that way.

But unlike chemically uniform nutrients, criticism isn't homogenous: different critics are differently equipped to notice different flaws in a piece of work.


[TODO: "know I want the truth" is a bad filter, salon bakery]


## Filtering Information Sources

> **Goofusia**: One shouldn't have to be the sort of person who follows discourse in crappy filter-bubbles in order to understand what's happening. The Rev. Samuel Parris's news summaries are the sort of thing that lets me do that. Our salon should work like that if it's going to talk about the atheist threat and the witchcraft crisis. I don't want to have to read the awful corners of the internet where this is discussed all day. They do truthseeking far worse there.
>
> **Gallantina**: But then you're turning your salon into a Rev. Parris filter bubble. Don't you want your salon members to be well-read? [TODO: followup question alluding to contamination frame]

This one is similar.

The "awful", "crappy", and "do[ing] truthseeking far worse there" characterizations are a tell.

[TODO: filtering interlocutors is more forgiveable if they're expensive, but reading contamination is wack]


## Suppressing Information Sources

> **Goofusia**: I caught Goody Osborne distributing pamphlets quoting the honest and candid and vulnerable reflections of Rev. Samuel Parris on guiding his flock, in pretty obviously reasonable ways, and just trying to somehow twist that into maximum anger and hatred. It seems quite clear to me what's going on in both of the relevant pamphlets, and I think signal boosting both of them is a pretty clear norm violation in my culture.
>
> **Gallantina**: I read those pamphlets. They seemed like intellectually substantive satire of a public figure. If it's a norm violation to signal-boost satire of public figures, 

This one is worse. Above, when Goofusia filtered who she talks to and what she reads, she was in an important sense only hurting herself.

The conjunction of "somehow" and "it seems quite clear to me" is a tell.


## An Analogy to Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback

[TODO: you can't "just not" do RLHF and still have a competitive AI in the current paradigm, but you can try to be aware of problems with supervision; it's better if the CEO says, "Yes, we thought of that, too; we think it's fine because of these-and-such mitigations." If the CEO says, "Well, _I_ think our raters are great. Are you insulting our raters?", that does not inspire confidence
