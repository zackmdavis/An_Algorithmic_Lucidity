## College Was Not That Terrible Now That I'm Not That Crazy

Previously, [I wrote about how I was considering going back to San Francisco State University for two semesters](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2024/05/should-i-finish-my-bachelors-degree/) to finish up my math B.A.

So, I did that. I think it was a good decision! I got more out of it than I expected.

To be clear, "better than I expected" is not an endorsement of college. SF State is still the same communist dystopia I remember from a dozen years ago—a bureaucratic command economy dripping in propaganda about how indispensible and humanitarian it is, whose subjects' souls have withered to the point where, even if they don't quite believe the propaganda, they can't conceive of life and work outside the system.

But it didn't hurt this time, because I had a sense of humor about it now—and a sense of perspective (thanks to life experience, no thanks to school). Ultimately, [policy debates should not appear one-sided](https://www.readthesequences.com/Policy-Debates-Should-Not-Appear-One-Sided): if things are terrible, it's probably not because people are choosing the straightforwardly terrible thing for no reason whatsoever, with no trade-offs, coordination problems, or nonobvious truths making the terrible thing look better than it is. The thing that makes life under communism unbearable is the fact that you can't leave. Having escaped, and coming back as a visiting dignitary, one is a better position to make sense of how and why the regime functions—the problems it solves, at whatever cost in human lives or dignity—the forces that make it stable if not good.

### Past Prologue

[prologue might get broken out into a separate post?]]

[TODO—
 * I would say I had a pretty normal school experience—public elementary school, then Jewish day school from 5th–8th grades after my parents thought I was sad in normal school, then public high school.
 * I had accepted the necessity of school==education because everyone said so; looking back, there are clues.
 * Reading stars and workbooks in 1st–2nd grade (they should have kept doing that!)
 * Time in middle school where they let us play games and I thought less of it; the time in high school where he had a class party and I described high school life as "easy" in my Diary 
 * The theme of intellectual ambition in my juvenillia: "The Greater Glory of Our Humble Academy" (and also, after my anti-school reformation, "Rusting in the Rain")
 * The time my mother asked if I was OK at Santa Cruz and suggested the idea of DVC at home, and I said, are you _trying_ to sabotage my education?
 * The time I thought I didn't want to go to college and wrote about it in my Diary (September 2005); "I could buy college textbooks and read them, all by myself"
 * I had a really bad nervous breakdown when I didn't know how to write my "Introduction to Feminisms" paper in fall 2007, intending to take up my Safeway job and then
 * Part of what made school hard was "the incomplete contract", not knowing what was allowed; at least in work there was more obviously a purpose other than to obey
 * I don't know why this didn't bother me in high school as much, perhaps because college was more obviously a choice; I think it didn't bother me in middle school as much because my adult conscience hadn't fully grown yet (I remember plagiarizing other kids' summaries of _As a Driven Leaf_ rather than doing the reading myself)
 * more evidence about the incomplete contract: asking Rich about how much of the reading he did at Stanford (contrast to Nicole in summer 2025 visit claiming she learned more in lecture and often skipped reading), Diary entry about linear algebra and office hours (and more confessions in Diary 260)
 * Meggie Sprengel
 * enrolled in Heald, thinking that "OK, they'll just teach me Job stuff" (which won't feel bad the way school did)
 * I remember staff at Heald being shocked at my high test scores
 * There was an elementary algebra requirement, which I imagined myself dominating, but I remember the staff saying I could clearly skip it because of my Santa Cruz calculus credits; they had a more pragmatic understanding of school than I did; the obedience test was all in my head!
 * Heald still felt awful and I had a crying fit and quit again; passed the A+ and Network+ on my own, but never converted those into a job (could I have, if I had searched harder?)
 * Fall 2010, tried to enroll in differential equations for fun, got "schooled", humiliating
 * Then felt like I had to finish my degree in order to prove that I could (note that I have Diary coverage of this period and can quote it)
 * DVC didn't have any more decent math classes; I took Calc III for completeness even though my vector-calc 23A from Santa Cruz might have covered it
 * "Competing Accounts of the Events of September 11, 2001: A Simplified and Incomplete Bayesian Analysis"
 * resenting the women-in-history professor not understanding what I was trying to do with the take-home test
 * summer history teacher, my objection to colored pencils, her bafflement that I was in her class (peeking at her reading my papers during the test while feeling guilty for not having eyes on my own paper)
 * book review log
 * including math in LyX in papers whenever possible
  * having to stay at DVC longer than I expected to cover the SFSU gened requirements (is there Diary coverage of this?)
 * "The Skriker and the Relativity of Aesthetic Value"
 * "_Anarchy Evolution_ and Selection as an Optimization Process" ("THis is the best community college paper I have ever read") "Shakespeare Is Overrated", inviting Julia Galef as guest lecturer
 * anxiety over whether to include Heald in transfer applications
 * Calc III show-off
 * no response from Schuster about "Real Analysis I"
 * bitterness and dejection at SFSU, Prof. Hosten being welcoming but not wanting to cover chapters ahead
 * Hayashi was nice, Putnam disappointment
  * a memory from 2013: he asked what a sequence was, I said, "A function from the naturals to the reals", he asked how I knew that, I said, "I know how to read"
 * obsessively doing lots of math in my private pages and neglecting my official schoolwork; B in "Probability and Statistics I", B+ in "Mathematical Optimization" (and I'm kind of suspicious of the grading curve there)
 * App Academy and rescue and happily ever after

### Doing It Right This Time (Math)

#### Real Analysis II (Fall 2024)

My last class at SF State in Spring 2013 (before getting rescued by the software industry) had been [Real Analysis I"](https://math.sfsu.edu/courses/370) with Prof. Alex Schuster. I regret that I wasn't in a state to properly focus and savor it at the time: I [had a pretty bad sleep-deprivation-induced psychotic break in early February 2013](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/03/religious/) and for a few months thereafter was [mostly just trying to hold myself together](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/04/prodrome/). I withdrew from my other classes ("Introduction to Functions of a Complex Variable" and "Urban Issues of Black Children and Youth") and ended up getting a B−.

My psychiatric impairment that semester was particularly disappointing because I had been looking forward to "Real Analysis I" as my first "serious" school math class, being concerned with proving theorems rather than applying given techniques to given problem classes. I had wanted to take it concurrently with the prerequsite, ["Exploration and Proof"](https://math.sfsu.edu/courses/301) (which I didn't consider sufficiently "serious") upon transferring to SFSU the previous semester, but was not permitted to. I had emailed Prof. Schuster asking to be allowed to enroll, with evidence that I was ready (attaching a PDF of a small result I had proved about analogues of π under the _p_-norm, and including the contact email of Prof. Robert Hasner of Diablo Valley College, who had been my "Calculus III" professor and had agreed to vouch for my preparedness), but he didn't reply.

Coming back eleven years later, I was eager to make up for that disappointment by picking up where I left off in "Real Analysis II" with the same Prof. Schuster. On the first day on instruction, I wore a collared shirt and tie (and mask, having contracted COVID-19 while traveling the previous week) and came to classroom early to make a point of marking my territory, using the whiteboard to write out the first part of a proof of the multivariate chain rule that I was working through in Bernd S. W. Schröder's _Mathematical Analysis: A Concise Introduction_—my favorite analysis textbook, which I had discovered in the SFSU library in 2012 and subsequently bought my own copy. (I would soon check up on the withdrawal stamp sheet in the front of the library's copy. No one had checked it out in the intervening twelve years.)

The official University Bulletin officially titled the course "Real Analysis II: Several Variables", so you'd expect trying to get a leg up on the multidimensional chain rule would be studying ahead for the course, but it turned out that the Bulletin was lying relative to the syllabus that Prof. Schuster had emailed out the week before: we would be covering series, series of functions, and metric space topology. Fine. (I was already pretty familiar with metric space topology, but even my "non-epsilon" calculus-level knowledge of series was weak; to me, the topic stunk of school rather than freedom.)

"Real II" was an intimate class that semester, befitting the SFSU's status as a [garbage-tier institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States#Map_of_R2_institutions): there were only seven or eight students enrolled. It was one of many classes in the department that were cross-listed as both a graduate ("MATH 770") and upper-division undergraduate course ("MATH 470"). I was the only student enrolled in 470. The university website [hosted an old syllabus from 2008](http://archive.today/2025.08.14-233957/https://math.sfsu.edu/courses/470) which said that the graduate students would additionally write a paper on an approved topic, but that wasn't a thing the way Prof. Schuster was teaching the class. Partway through the semester, I was added to Canvas (the online course management system) for the 770 class, to save Prof. Schuster and the TA Sean Hadley the hassle of maintaining both.

The textbook was _An Introduction to Analysis_ by William R. Wade, the same book that had been used for "Real I" in Spring 2013. It felt in bad taste for reasons that are hard to precisely articulate. I want to say the tone is patronizing, but don't feel like I could defend that judgement in debate against someone who doesn't share it. What I love about Schröder is how it tries to simultaneously be friendly to the novice (the early chapters sprinkling analysis tips and tricks as numbered "Standard Proof Techniques" among the numbered theorems and definitions) while also showcasing the fearsome technicality of the topic in excruciatingly detailed estimates (proofs involving chains of inequalities, typically ending on "< ε"). In contrast, Wade often feels like it's hiding something from children who are now in fact teenagers.

The assignments were a lot of work, but that was good. It was what I was there for—to prove that I could do the work.

Prof. Schuster held his office hours in the math department conference room rather than his office, which created a nice environment for multiple people to work or socialize, in addition to asking Prof. Schuster questions. I came almost every time, whether or not I had an analysis question for Prof. Schuster. Often there were other students from "Real II" or Prof. Schuster's "Real I" class there, or a lecturer who also enjoyed the environment, but sometimes it was just me.

Office hours chatter didn't confine itself to math. Prof. Schuster sometimes wore a Free Palestine bracelet. I asked him what I should read to understand the pro-Palestinian position, which had been neglected in my Jewish upbringing. He recommended Rashid Khalidi's _The Hundred Years' War on Palestine_, which I read and found informative (in contrast to the student pro-Palestine demonstrators on campus, who I found anti-persuasive).

The culture of school didn't feel quite as bad as I remembered. It's unclear to me how much of this is due to my memory having stored a hostile caricature, and how much is due to my being less sensitive to it this time. When I was at SFSU a dozen years ago, I remember seething with hatred at how everyone talked about their studies in terms of classes and teachers and grades, rather than about the subject matter in itself. There was still a lot of that—bad enough that I complained about it at every opportunity—but I wasn't seething with hatred anymore, as if I had come to terms with it as mere dysfunction and not sacrilege.

 * People talk about math courses by number: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix


 * time for the Stone-Weirstrass
 * Prof. "A" impressed when a student mentioned ZFC; I think this is "knowing how to read" territory and should not be impressive
 * 82% midterm
 * botching a compactness proof on the final


#### Probability Models (Fall 2024)

 * Mujamdar
 * prereqs: linear algebra, probability and statistics I (now math 440), and calc III
 * I had to get an add code 
 * didn't quite have the same rapport in office hours; lanauge and culture might have made a difference

#### The Putnam Exam

I also organized a team for the Putnam Competition, SFSU's first in institutional memory. (I'm really proud of [my recruitment advertisements](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2025/01/recruitment-advertisements-for-the-2024-putnam-competition-at-san-francisco-state-university/) to the _math\_majors@lists.sfsu.edu_ mailing list.) The story of the Putnam effort has been recounted in a separate post, ["The End of the Movie: SF State's 2024 Putnam Competition Team, A Retrospective"](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2025/01/the-end-of-the-movie-sf-state-2024-putnam-competition-team-a-retrospective/).

As the email headers at the top of the post indicate, the post was originally composed for the department mailing lists, but it never actually got published there: department chair Eric Hsu wrote to me that it was "much too long to send directly to the whole department" but asked for my "permission to eventually share it with the department, either as a link or possibly as a department web page." (He cc'd a department office admin who I had spoken to about posting the Putnam training session announcements on the mailing list; reading between the lines, I'm imagining that she was discomfited by the tone of the post and appealed to Prof. Hsu's authority about whether to let it through.)

I assumed that the ask to share with the department "eventually" was polite bullshit on Hsu's part to let me down gently. (Probably no one gets to be department chair without being molded into a master of polite bullshit.) Privately, I didn't think the rationale made sense—it's just as easy to delete a long unwanted mailing list message as a short one; the email server wasn't going to run out of _paper_—but it seemed petty to argue. I replied that I hadn't known the rules for the mailing list and that he should feel free to share or not as he saw fit.

#### Measure and Integration (Spring 2025)



#### Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable (Spring 2025)

 * the course numbers are actually informative

#### Modern Algebra I (Spring 2025)

One of the quirks of being an autodidact is that it's easy to end up with an "unbalanced" skill profile relative to what school authorities expect. As a student of mathematics, I consider myself more of an analyst than an algebraist and had not previously prioritized learning abstract algebra nor (what the school authorities cared about) "taking" an algebra "class", neither last semester nor in Fall 2012/Spring 2013. (Over the years, I had taken a few [desultory swings at Dummit & Foote](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2019/05/group-theory-for-wellness-i/), but never got very far.)

But "Modern Algebra I" was a graduation requirement,

so I found myself in Prof. Dusty Ross




Prof. Ross is an outstanding schoolteacher, the best I encountered at SFSU. I choose my words here very carefully. _My_ favorite professor was Alex Schuster.




Prof. Ross is a better teacher, but Prof. Schuster is a better person, because Dusty Ross _believes_ in San Francisco State University; Alex Schuster just works there.

### Cynicism and Sanity

 * the linear algebra credits
 * Grief that I didn't know how to do this when I was young; I could have majored in math (even if I'm actually a philosopher) and taken the Putnam and started my career in 2010
 * The TA recommeneded I look up the solution manual online 
 * clicking through anti-harrassment training is obviously OK
 * a memory of "mandatory orientation"
 * LLM use and citing it
 * quiz resubmit for half-credit thing
 * ducking out of class to coordinate on the Putnam registration
 * being more aggressive about working the system
 * Peter Verdone
 * it was chance that I ended up deciding to finish before moving; finishing at Reno would be harder
