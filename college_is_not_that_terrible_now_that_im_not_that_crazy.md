## College Was Not That Terrible Now That I'm Not That Crazy

Previously, [I wrote about how I was considering going back to San Francisco State University for two semesters](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2024/05/should-i-finish-my-bachelors-degree/) to finish up my math B.A.

So, I did that. I think it was a good decision! I got more out of it than I expected.

To be clear, "better than I expected" is not an endorsement of college. SF State is still the same communist dystopia I remember from a dozen years ago—a bureaucratic command economy dripping in propaganda about how indispensible and humanitarian it is, whose subjects' souls have withered to the point where, even if they don't quite believe the propaganda, they can't conceive of life and work outside the system.

But it didn't hurt this time, because I had a sense of humor about it now—and a sense of perspective (thanks to life experience, no thanks to school). Ultimately, [policy debates should not appear one-sided](https://www.readthesequences.com/Policy-Debates-Should-Not-Appear-One-Sided): if things are terrible, it's probably not because people are choosing the straightforwardly terrible thing for no reason whatsoever, with no trade-offs, coordination problems, or nonobvious truths making the terrible thing look better than it is. The thing that makes life under communism unbearable is the fact that you can't leave. Having escaped, and coming back as a visiting dignitary, one is a better position to make sense of how and why the regime functions—the problems it solves, at whatever cost in human lives or dignity—the forces that make it stable if not good.

### Doing It Right This Time

My last class at SF State in Spring 2013 (before getting rescued by the software industry) had been [Real Analysis I"](https://math.sfsu.edu/courses/370) with Prof. "A". I regret that I wasn't in a state to properly focus and savor it at the time: I [had a pretty bad sleep-deprivation-induced psychotic break in early February 2013](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/03/religious/) and for a few months thereafter was [mostly just trying to hold myself together](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/04/prodrome/). I withdrew from my other classes and ended up getting a B−.

My psychiatric impairment that semester was particularly disappointing because I had been looking forward to "Real Analysis I" as my first "serious" school math class (being concerned with proving theorems rather than applying given techniques to given problem classes). I had wanted to take it concurrently with the prerequsite, ["Exploration and Proof"](https://math.sfsu.edu/courses/301) upon transferring to SFSU the previous semester, but was not permitted to. I had emailed Prof. "A" asking to be allowed to enroll, with evidence that I was ready (attaching a PDF of a small result I had proved about analogues of π under the _p_-norm, and including the contact email of my community college "Calculus III" professor, who agreed to vouch for my preparedness), but he didn't reply.

Coming back eleven years later, I was eager to make up for that disappointment by picking up where I left off in ["Real Analysis II"](https://webapps.sfsu.edu/public/classservices/classsearch/detail/2247/REG/6041) with the same Prof. "A". I came to the classroom early the first day and made a point of marking my territory, using the whiteboard

a proof of the multivariate chain rule

 * https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix

 * Picking up where I left off: my last class but SFSU was "Real Analysis I" with Prof. A in Spring 2013, this is "Real Analysis II" with Prof. A in Fall 2024,
  * People talk about math courses by number
 * a memory from 2013: he asked what a sequence was, I said, "A function from the naturals to the reals", he asked how I knew that, I said, "I know how to read"
 * First day, I "marked my territory" by showing up and writing the multidimensional chain rule on the board
 * Prof. "A" does office hours in a conference room, which is great
 * The syllabus is a lie: you might expect that "Several Variables" (https://math.sfsu.edu/courses/470) would cover Stokes, but we actually covered series, series of functions, and metric spaces
 * intimate class: like 7 people
 * 470/770 split: I was the only undergraduate in "Math 470"
 * free Palestine and Rashid Khalidi
 * time for the Stone-Weirstrass
 * Prof. "A" impressed when a student mentioned ZFC; I think this is "knowing how to read" territory and should not be impressive
 * 82% midterm
 * botching a compactness proof on the final
 * didn't quite have the same rapport in office hours; lanauge and culture might have made a difference

 * Getting a C- is the funniest possible outcome
 * forum post
 
### Cynicism and Sanity

 * the linear algebra credits
 * Grief that I didn't know how to do this when I was young; I could have majored in math (even if I'm actually a philosopher) and taken the Putnam and started my career in 2010
 * The TA recommeneded I look up the solution manual online 
 * clicking through anti-harrassment training is obviously OK
 * tutoring center punch card
 * LLM use and citing it
 * quiz resubmit for half-credit thing
 * ducking out of class to coordinate on the Putnam registration
 * being more aggressive about working the system

I'm alienated from schoolwork (I don't remember it the way I remember my blogging), but ... I'm also kind of alienated from paid work? (I wrote a lot of code for SwiftStack and Coalition, it's not salient in the way my own projects are)

"Each question should be about 4-6 sentences as you ask the question and give context."—I'm not sure I met that

https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2025/05/09/cheaters-gonna-cheat-cheat-cheat-cheat-cheat/

if I wanted to avoid this particular source of moral ambiguity at all costs but still wanted a Bachelor's degree, I could have taken easier classes for which I wouldn't need so much LLM assistance to help with the material ... it's just that that would be insane. I think the thing I'm doing now, of jointly trying to maximize math knowledge while also participating in the standard system to help with that, makes sense, and minimizing perceived moral ambiguity (which is all in my head) is just a really stupid goal


Prof. Lai feedback on assignment #7: "I like your footnote. Very genuine and is a modern way of learning math."

"Self, Place, and Knowing" quiz; I think I remember succumbing to temptation to look at the PDF at one point, but it didn't counterfactually change my answer

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-102-introduction-to-functional-analysis-spring-2009/resources/mit18_102s09_pset01/
"Write out a proof (you can steal it from one of many places but at least write it out in your own hand)"

https://www.thefp.com/p/ai-everyones-cheating-thats-good-news

Estimate: I did "about" 25.5 pages of complex analysis homework/takehomes (plus 4 page expository paper) and 17.25 pages of measure theory homework. So if I start doing private work to the same standard, say 60 pages is the equivalent of a school semester?
