## College Is Not That Terrible Now That I'm Not That Crazy??

 * Previously: http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2024/05/should-i-finish-my-bachelors-degree/
 * SF State is still the communist dystopia I remember from a dozen years ago, but it doesn't hurt this time, because I have a sense of humor about it now
 * Communist dystopia: propaganda about how beneficial and humanitarian it is, but authoritarian command economies are not human
 * People talk about math courses by number
 * We submit our homework through the online course portal; other than that, everything is the same

### My Tragic Backstory

 * went to UCSC out of high school, intended to major in philosophy
 * nervous beakdown triggered by "Intro to Feminisms" 
 * I believed in school==education; "my mandate to the University" mentioned in my Diary, "are you trying to sabotage my education?" when mom asked if maybe it was better if I lived at home
 * TODO: read my "prodigal son" letter to recapture the spirit
 * Heald
 * differential equations debacle
 * DVC
 * SFSU

### Doing It Right This Time: "Real Analysis II" and "Probability Models"

 * Picking up where I left off: my last class but SFSU was "Real Analysis I" with Prof. A in Spring 2013, this is "Real Analysis II" with Prof. A in Fall 2024
 * a memory from 2013: he asked what a sequence was, I said, "A function from the naturals to the reals", he asked how I knew that, I said, "I know how to read"
 * First day, I "marked my territory" by showing up and writing the multidimensional chain rule on the board
 * Prof. "A" does office hours in a conference room, which is great
 * The syllabus is a lie: you might expect that "Several Variables" (https://math.sfsu.edu/courses/470) would cover Stokes, but we actually covered series, series of functions, and metric spaces
 * intimate class: like 7 people
 * 470/770 split: I was the only undergraduate in "Math 470"
 * free Palestine and Rashid Khalidi
 * time for the Stone-Weirstrass
 * Prof. "A" impressed when a student mentioned ZFC; I think this is "knowing how to read" territory and should not be impressive
 * 82% midterm
 * botching a compactness proof on the final
 * didn't quite have the same rapport in office hours; lanauge and culture might have made a difference
 * quiz resubmit for half-credit thing
 * LLM use and citing it


### "Queer Literatures and Media"

 * Getting a C- is the funniest possible outcome
 * 
 
### Cynicism and Sanity

 * Grief that I didn't know how to do this when I was young; I could have majored in math (even if I'm actually a philosopher) and taken the Putnam and started my career in 2010
 * The TA recommeneded I look up the solution manual online 
 * clicking through anti-harrassment training is obviously OK
 * tutoring center punch card

the fiction of "grade level"

re studying for life vs. studying for school, people also exercise outside of sports, but I _did_ train harder when I was competingâ€”you could say, that was different because this is a matter of the soul
