Every Hollywood underdog story starts with a dream. [The scrawny working-class kid who wants to play football for Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_(film)). [The charismatic teacher at a majority Latino school in East L.A. who inspires his class to ace the AP Calculus exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_and_Deliver). [The debate team at a historically black college that unseats the reigning national champions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Debaters) Hollywood tells us that if you work hard and believe in yourself, you can defy all expectations and achieve your dream.

Hollywood preys on the philosophically unsophisticated. [Chebyshev's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality) states that the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean by _k_ standard deviations is no more than 1/_k_². Well-calibrated expectations should already take into account how hard you'll work and how much you'll believe in yourself: underdogs mostly lose _by definition_.

Accordingly, this story starts with a correspondingly humble dream: the not-a-kid-anymore [returning to SFSU after a long absence to finish up his math degree](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2024/05/should-i-finish-my-bachelors-degree/), who wants to get a nonzero score in Putnam exam. (It's not quite as humble as it sounds: the median score in the famously brutal elite competition is often zero out of 120, although last year the median was ten.)

The first step on the road to a nonzero score was to be able to compete at all: SF State had no immediate history of participating in the event. At SFSU in 2012, I had asked one of my professors about registering for the Putnam, and nothing came of it. This time, a more proactive approach was called for. After reaching out to the chair and several professors who had reasons to decline the role ("I'm not a fan of the Putnam", "I have negative time this semester", "You should ask one of the smart professors"), Prof. Arek Goetz agreed to serve as local superivor.

A prepation session #1 to discuss the solutions to [problems from the 2010 competition](https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2010.pdf) was scheduled and advertised on the math-majors mailing list (Subject: "Putnam prep session for eternal mathematical glory, 4 p.m. Thu 19 September"). Despite some interest expressed in email, no non-organizer participants showed up ... but on comparing the [2010 solutions](https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2010s.pdf) to my flailing attempts over the previous week, I had solved one—

> **B2**. Given that A, B, and C are noncollinear points in the plane with integer coordinates such that the distances AB, AC, and BC are integers, what is the smallest possible value of AB?

The obvious "dumb" guess is 3, from the smallest [Pythagorean triple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple) 3–4–5. Can we do better?—is there some integer-coordinate triangle with a side of 1 or 2?

The Pythagorean theorem generalizes to the law of cosines: c² = a² + b² − 2ab cos θ. We can't go down to c := 2 with integer a and b because—

[...]

The dream was alive!


[TODO: the law of cosines thing wasn't a proof, but the fact that I intuited the right answer meant that the dream was alive]
