### Past Prologue

#### Prehistory

I wasn't always like this. Until I quit college the first time, I had a pretty normal school experience for my social background: public elementary school in a good suburb, then Jewish day school from 5th to 8th grades, then back to public high school, then to the University of California at Santa Cruz—before everything changed. It's only in retrospect that there were clues that something was wrong.

It started out fine. I remember in first grade getting a sequence of arithmetic workbooks and going through them much faster than most of the other children, like being on chapter 30 when Chelsea was only on chapter 6. I needed help from the teacher when I got to multi-digit subtraction with borrowing. I remember in second grade, Mrs. Wright had a practice of "reading stars"—for every so many minutes of reading, the name of the book would be written by one of the points of a yellow construction paper five-point star. I earned _so many stars_.

At some point, they stopped giving me workbooks and reading stars to race through and just had classes with all the children listening to the same teacher and obeying the teacher's commands at the same pace. In retrospect, this seems obviously worse and insane, but at the time, I had no standard of comparison from which to object to anything.

A crucial part of my complaint that schoolbound souls might not understand is that when I complain about being expected to obey the teacher's commands, I don't mean in contrast to not doing any intellectual work at all, and only doing frivolous and "fun" things. I'm saying that the arithmetic workbooks (offering me a choice of pace) and reading stars (offering a choice of book) were a superior form of intellectual work.

I don't look particularly fondly on "fun" school activities lacking substance. In Jewish middle school, they gave us an occasional period to play games, which I remember looking down on. I didn't look down on recess, during which the other boys and I would often play basketball or touch football—but that was understood as _recess_, not a class period.

In January 2005, my 11th grade English teacher had a class party at the conclusion of our unit on _The Great Gatsby_. I wrote in my Diary: "Fancy that all this happened during hours when we were supposed to be, you know, learning stuff! Sometimes I feel guilty that my life, this high school life is too easy." I was not wise enough to spontaneously generate the obvious followup thought, that I could and should have been doing harder work.

I did read a lot: books, and then blogs and _Wikipedia_. I liked Isaac Asimov and Ayn Rand, and later, Greg Egan. In high school, I started keeping little pocket notebooks and writing in them in preference to paying attention in class—nothing very structured, just rambling and observations and scraps of dialogue. I tried to write fiction, but never seemed to finish any stories. I got the farthest with "The Greater Glory of Our Humble Academy", a novella about a school of prodigies fielding a girls' cross-country team, the draft of which surpassed 22,000 words before permanently running out of stream. You can see my worship of intelligence in the draft; from my current perspective, it looks like trying too hard to show off how well-read I was.

The contrast between my intellectual ambition (expressed in my reading and my notebooks and half-finished stories) and the monotony of my schooling wouldn't have been a contradiction if it had been a conscious strategic choice—to do a passable job of obeying my teachers because Society demanded it, while getting the real work done on my own time. That is what I was effectively doing. (I only took one Advanced Placement class during high school, "Calculus AB", which is not the academic record one might expect on reading "The Greater Glory".) But for the most part, I consciously accepted the conflation of education and schooling, because that's what everyone in Society seemed to believe.

There were doubts. In September 2005, I wrote in my Diary that I felt as if I didn't want to go to college. I fantasized about getting a job and being independent as soon as possible. "If I were to stop my formal education after high school, would [that] really be a sort of intellectual suicide?" I wrote. "I don't think so. I could buy college textbooks and read them, all by myself." But that was just a passing fantasy; actually forgoing college was unthinkable given my social background. The next year, I enrolled at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and I was ego-syntonic about it. My mother once asked if I was doing okay at Santa Cruz, and floated the idea of living at home and taking classes at community college. I said, "Are you _trying_ to sabotage my education?"

#### University of California, Santa Cruz (Fall 2006–Fall 2007)

I was not doing okay at Santa Cruz. I cried a lot.

I went through a period where I was terrified of either accidentally committing plagiarism or being falsely accused of plagiarism. We don't have introspective access to where all our ideas come from. How could I _know_ whether an idea I thought of as "mine", I might have actually read about somewhere and then forgotten that I had read it?

Professors would assign readings, and I would get stressed out about what constituted a "reading": if I felt myself skim over a paragraph, did I have to go back and make sure my eyes touched every word? If I didn't do the reading, did I have an obligation to confess this to the instructor, so that they could hypothetically mark me down for it?

When I had trouble with a math problem and received help from a TA, I wasn't sure how I should indicate that on my homework submission. It seemed morally dubious to just copy down the steps without some sort of barrier to indicate which parts were me _vs._ not-me. (The standard injunction was to "show _your_ work", not just "show work", right?) On a homework paper for my Winter 2007 linear algebra class, I used red pen to clarify, "NOTE red ink indicates corrections/additions made at section 22 February".

The unifying theme in these neuorses was that of an incomplete contract. I liked learning about "academic" topics, of course, but I implicitly felt as if in school, my job was not to learn, but to comply with the teacher's commands, and I couldn't bear it not being absolutely clear what constituted correct compliance. I must have known at some level that my scrupulosity was unusual, but that didn't make it stop hurting.

I don't know why the incomplete contract apparently hadn't bothered me so much in high school. Maybe it had something to do with college attendance being more overtly a choice rather than a legal imposition? I know it hadn't bothered me in middle school, before my adult conscience had grown. (They had us read _As a Driven Leaf_ and write chapter summaries as homework; I remember summarizing another student's summary a few times when I hadn't read the chapter myself.)

Events came to a head at the end of the quarter of Fall 2007, when I found myself unable to bring myself to complete the final essay for for Prof. Bettina Aptheker's famous "Introduction to Feminisms" course; I had felt like the class was taught in a dialect of English I couldn't speak. As a male being permitted to take a feminist studies course, the shame of my failure to obey was unbearable. I had a complete mental breakdown, crying and screaming for hours, "I betrayed them; I betrayed them." When it was over, I wrote a letter to my parents (in my overwrought purple prose) expressing my intent to withdraw from the University, go back to my supermarket job, and be an autodidact.

I ended up getting a B+ in "Introduction to Feminisms." I wrote to the T.A. that this "puzzled me, because I thought it had been manifest that my performance merited an F or D grade." I concluded, "This email is just to alert you to this error." (She sent me a nice reply explaining that it wasn't an error, that she and Prof. Aptheker had valued my work.)

#### Heald Career College (2008)

In mid-2008, I enrolled in the network administration program at Heald career college, on the theory they could _just_ teach me job-relevant skills, without inserting their authority between me and the books of my real education. I thought that that wouldn't be torture the way that the University had been. I remember staff being surprised at my high scores on the entry test. (People with my IQ usually go to university, not career college.) The program had an elementary algebra requirement, which I imagined myself dominating and thereby attaining atonement for the sins of my failures to comply in my university math classes. They waived the algebra requirement on account of my UCSC calculus credits. In retrospect, waiving the requiement is obviously sensible and my vision of "atonement" was insane. Evidently, the career college staff had a more pragmatic understanding of the purpose of school than I did. (If someone is certified as knowing calculus, there's no reason for them to sit through an elementary algebra class.) The obedience test was all in my head.

[TODO: the union rep wouldn't waive the 24 hour entitlement]

Nevertheless, Heald was still a school despite the "career" focus, and the torturous obedience test in my head was still active. I had another crying fit and quit again before the first term was over. Part of the program would have involved taking the A+ and Network+ certification exams. I got the books and passed those on my own, but never ended up converting them into a job; maybe I could have if I had tried harder.

#### Independence 2008–2010

In fall 2008, I got the idea that my autodidacticism should include mathematics and started studying linear algebra from the textbook I had used at UCSC. When I had had my fill of linear algebra, I followed it up with work from books on complex analysis and discrete math, and various other math and programming excursions I came across: I [figured out how 1/x can be the derivative of log x even though the latter isn't defined for x≤0](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2011/12/the-derivative-of-the-natural-logarithm/). I worked out a formula for the disjunction of independent events of probablity _p_ (and was later informed by a friend that DeMorgan's law gives a much simpler formula). I got a quantitative evolutionary theory book and tried to generalize the Hardy–Weinberg law to the science-fictional hypothetical case of a genome having three alleles per locus (in which case the famous Punnett square becomes a cube). I kept all my notes and exercises in a continuous sequence of numbered pages divided into two columns.

In April 2009, I visited the UCSC campus to see my friends and visit the office hours of Prof. Patrick Tantalo (who had taught that linear algebra class) and Prof. Aptheker. I told Prof. Tantalo about my mathematical exploits, but disclaimed several times that I wasn't even a "math person"; he wisely asked what that even meant.

[TODO: Aptheker visit; check email for more evidence of Aptheker intent]

I suspected I might have gotten more studying done than my friends during the visit.

[TODO 2009-2010—
  * anxiety about the idea of being a programmer
  * Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation for SingInst internship (Anna suggested just Turing machines, but I did the earlier stuff)
  * vector calc
  * microeconomic theory
  * I read the PageRank paper; I had a UC Berkeley library card for the public and read Kevin S. Van Horn's guide to Cox's theorem

#### Diablo Valley College (Fall 2010–Spring 2012)

[TODO "Differential Equations"—
In fall 2010, I decided to enroll in

 * page number checkpoint before discussing diffeq.

 * entry test
 * Fall 2010, tried to enroll in differential equations for fun, got "schooled", humiliating
 * quote Diary coverage
]

I got a C. At that point, I felt like I had to finish my degree in order to prove that I could.

[TODO DVC—

 * DVC didn't have any more decent math classes; I took Calc III for completeness even though my vector-calc 23A from Santa Cruz might have covered it
 * "Competing Accounts of the Events of September 11, 2001: A Simplified and Incomplete Bayesian Analysis"
 * summer history teacher, my objection to colored pencils, her bafflement that I was in her class (peeking at her reading my papers during the test while feeling guilty for not having eyes on my own paper)
* resenting the women-in-history professor not understanding what I was trying to do with the take-home test; ceasing to try on subsequent tests and feeling bad about that
 * book review log
 * including math in LyX in papers whenever possible
  * having to stay at DVC longer than I expected to cover the SFSU gened requirements (is there Diary coverage of this?)
 * "The Skriker and the Relativity of Aesthetic Value"

 * no response from Schuster about "Real Analysis I"
 * bitterness and dejection at SFSU, Prof. Hosten being welcoming but not wanting to cover chapters ahead
 * Hayashi was nice, Putnam disappointment
 * a memory from 2013: he asked what a sequence was, I said, "A function from the naturals to the reals", he asked how I knew that, I said, "I know how to read"
 * obsessively doing lots of math in my private pages and neglecting my official schoolwork; B in "Probability and Statistics I", B+ in "Mathematical Optimization" (and I'm kind of suspicious of the grading curve there)

#### Escape

[TODO—
 * App Academy and rescue and happily ever after
 * Pugh informal audit
